# LeNet5-Tifinagh-AMHCD
LeNet-5 for AMHCD is a classical CNN implementation adapted for Amazigh character recognition. It uses TensorFlow/Keras to process the AMHCD (RGB) dataset, demonstrating the flexibility of the architecture to handle Tifinagh characters. This project serves as an example of applying foundational models to new visual domains.
